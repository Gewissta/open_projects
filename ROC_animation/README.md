# Animations with receiver operating characteristic and precision-recal curves. 

## Usage
Please feel free to use the animations and scripts in this repository for teaching or learning. If you want to recreate the animations in this repository, you will need the following packages to run the various scripts:

- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`
- `cowplot`
- `gganimate`
- `magick`
- `mgcv`

## Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

Receiver operating characteristic curve displays how well a model can classify two binary outcomes. For example, a model is made to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. ROC curve demonstrate how well the model can tell whether a benign tumor is benign and whether the malignant tumor is malignant. An ROC curve is displayd by plotting a false positive rate and a true positive rate, like you see below.
