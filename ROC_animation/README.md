# Animations with receiver operating characteristic and precision-recal curves. 

## Usage
Please feel free to use the animations and scripts in this repository for teaching or learning. If you want to recreate the animations in this repository, you will need the following packages to run the various scripts:

- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`
- `cowplot`
- `gganimate`
- `magick`
- `mgcv`

## Receiver operating characteristic 


The script `animate_ROC.r` will generate `ROC.gif`.

The script `animate_cutoff.r` will generate `cutoff.gif`.
