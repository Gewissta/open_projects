# Animations with receiver operating characteristic and precision-recal curves 

## Usage
Please feel free to use the animations and scripts in this repository for teaching or learning. You can directly download the [gif files](animations) for any of the animations, or you can recreate them using these [scripts](R). Each script is named according to the animation it generates (i.e. `animate_ROC.r` generates `ROC.gif` and `animate_SD.r` generates `SD.gif`).

## Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

Receiver operating characteristic curve displays how well a model can classify binary outcomes. For example, a model is made to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. An ROC curve demonstrates how well the model can tell whether a benign tumor is benign or whether a malignant tumor is malignant. 

An ROC curve is made by plotting a false positive rate against a true positive rate for each possible cutoff value. In my tumor example, we can assume that the positive outcome is malignant. Then, the true positive rate is the fraction of malignant tumors that were correctly identified as malignant, and the false positive rate is the fraction of benign tumors that were incorrectly identified as malignant.

The plot on the left is the distribution of predictors for two outcomes. The vertical line that travels left-to-right is the cutoff that separates the positive and negative outcomes. In my tumor example, a cutoff is a predictor value that seperates benign from malignant tumors. A predictor value above the cutoff would classify a tumor as malignant, and a predictor value below the cutoff would classify a tumor as benign (assuming that positive outcome is malignant). Changing the cutoff value does not change the shape of the ROC curve.

"AUC" in the title of the right plot stands for area under the curve. AUC tells us the area under the ROC curve, and, generally, a high AUC value is indicative of a model that can distinguish between the two outcomes well. Typically, AUC values of 0.7 are considered to be good. In a later section you will see the case when a model with a higher AUC value is not necessarily better than a model with a lower AUC value.

The shape of an ROC curve changes only if the model outcome changes.

The animation starts with a poor model that cannot tell one outcome from the other, and the two distributions completely overlap. As the two distributions separate, The ROC curve approaches the left top corner, and the AUC value of the curve increases. When a model can perfectly separate two outcomes, an ROC curves form a right angle and AUC becomes 1. 

## Precision-recall curve

Precision-recall curve also displays how well a model can classify binary outcomes. However, it does it differently than an ROC curve. Precision-recall curve plots true positive rate (recall or sensitivity) against the positive predictive value (precision). Positive predictive value is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of total positive calls, and it is meant to measure the positive outcomes that were called correctly among all positive results. The shape of the precision-recall curve also changes as the model outcome changes. When a model can perfectly separate two outcomes, a precision-recall curve forms a right angle like an ROC curve but in a different direction.

## Precision-recall curve is more sensitive to class imbalanace than an ROC curve

Class imbalance happens when the number of outputs in one class is different from the number of outputs in another class. For example, one of the distributions has 1000 observations and the other has 10. An ROC curve is more robust to class imbalanace that a precision-recall curve.

In this animation, both distributions start with 1000 outcomes. The blue one is then reduced to 50. The precision-recall curve changes shape more drastically than the ROC curve, and the AUC value mostly stays the same. This pattern remains when the other class is reduced.

## AUC value can be misleading 

When the standard deviation of one of the distribution changes, AUC value increases. This should indicate that the model performance has increased, when, actually, the prediction performance becomes worse at small false positive rates.
